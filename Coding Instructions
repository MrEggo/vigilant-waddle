# Codes to remember!
# These are beginner codes.
print("Whatever you want goes inside these quotations")
you_choose_variable_name=("Integer or string. String is words.")
print(you_choose_variable_name) #Will print what you made you_choose_variable_name say. In this case it will print Integer or string. String is words
# There are also booleans which are True or False which you can assign to a variable.
print(you_choose_variable_name.upper()) #Will make the string you assigned to you_choose_variable_name all uppercase.
print(you_choose_variable_name.lower()) #Will make the string you assigned to you_choose_variable_name all lowercase.
print(you_choose_variable_name.count("t")) #Will see how many times a t appears.
print(you_choose_variable_name.find("String")) #Will  find where the word string is.

# Next we are going to do the replace function.

replace_function= "Replace Function"
replace_function.replace("Function", "Replace")

# Also you can replace with words you have not created. Watch how.

Hello= "Hello World"
Hello_World= Hello.replace("World", "Folks")

# You can also update the variable so you can put words in you have not out in the code yet Watch how!

Hello= "Hello World"
Hello= Hello.replace("World", "Folks")

# Next we will learn how to add variables together.

Hello= "Hello"
Space= " "
Name= "MrEggo"
Greeting= Hello + Space + Name

# Next is another way of adding variables together.

Welcome= "welcome!"
Question= "How are you?"
Combination_Of_Welcome_And_Question= "{} {}".format(Welcome, Question)

# The way you find out what all the functions do is:
print(help(str))

Next is math.

# Arithmetic Operators:
# Addition:       3 + 2
# Subtraction:    3 - 2
# Multiplication: 3 * 2
# Division:       3 / 2
# Floor Division: 3 // 2
# Exponent:       3 ** 2
# Modulus:        3 % 2


# Comparisons:
# Equal:            3 == 2
# Not Equal:        3 != 2
# Greater Than:     3 > 2
# Less Than:        3 < 2
# Greater or Equal: 3 >= 2
# Less or Equal:    3 <= 2

#Math Coding
num=1
num+= 1
print(num)
num2_0=1
num2_0*=10
print(num2_0)
num3_0=4
num3_0/=2
print(num3_0)
print(abs(-100)) #abs means absolute value.

#If you want to round type

print(round(3.75, 1))
#If we just typed 3.75 it would have rounded to 4. Since we put the comma it rounded up to 3.8.

#Next if we have a variable assigend to "2", that would be a string so how do we turn it into a integer? Watch how.
soon_to_be_int= "2"
soon_to_be_int2= "5"

soon_to_be_int= int(soon_to_be_int)
soon_to_be_int2= int(soon_to_be_int2)

#Next you will be learning an array/list

names= ["Me", "Sister", "Mom", "Grandma", "Cousin1", "Cousin2"] #Arrays start from  0 then go up. So there are 6 things I wrote but the AI will only recognize 5. If I want to print one of these things do this:
print(names[0]) #I wrote 0 but you could have wrote anything 0-5.

#If I wanted to get two things from the list I would do.

print(names[0:3])

#To get anything below something you do:

print(names[:3])

#To get anything above something you do:

print(names[3:])

#To add a thing to a list you do:

names.append("Cousin3")

#To put it in a specific spot you would do:

names.insert(0,"Cousin4") #0 is the spot where it says me. It would make Cousin4 take the spot of Me. You do not have to have 0 as the first argument.

#Next if we want to add another list you do this to our current list:

names_to_remember= ["Her", "Him] #Just adding another list
names.extend(names_to_remember) #Will add Him and Her to the orriginal list.

#To remove a value you use the remove function

names.remove(Cousin4)

#To revers the code use the reverse function:

names.reverse()

#To sort the list you use the sort function:

names.sort()

#To put this in decending order in the parenthesees you put:

names.sort(reverse=True)

#To get a sorted version without altering the variable you do:

sorted_names= sorted(names)

#If we wanted to do something cool with numbers listen close:
nums= [1,4,9,2,8,6,5,7,3] #You can do all those functions we did with the names list.
print(min(nums)) #Will print the smallest number
print(max(nums)) #Will print largest number
print(sum(nums)) #Will add all the numbers together

#Okay the next thing we will do is learn the index command.

word= ["Hello", "Bye", "Large", "Small"]
print(word.index("Large") #Will find where the word large is

#To find out if a word is in our list we do:

print("Huge" in word)

#To see the words and the place you use this function

for index, words in enumerate(word):
  print(index, words)
  
#When we are making the code do the enumerate you can make it start at a certain number

for index, words in enumerate(word, start=1):
  print(index, words)
