#Codes to remember!
#These are beginner codes.
print("Whatever you want goes inside these quotations")
you_choose_variable_name=("Integer or string. String is words.")
print(you_choose_variable_name) #Will print what you made you_choose_variable_name say. In this case it will print Integer or string. String is words
#There are also booleans which are True or False which you can assign to a variable/
print(you_choose_variable_name.upper()) #Will make the string you assigned to you_choose_variable_name all uppercase.
print(you_choose_variable_name.lower()) #Will make the string you assigned to you_choose_variable_name all lowercase.
print(you_choose_variable_name.count("t") #Will see how many times a t appears.
print(you_choose_variable_name.find("String") #Will  find where the word string is.

#Next we are going to do the replace function.

replace_function= "Replace Function"
replace_function.replace("Function", "Replace")

#Also you can replace with words you have not created. Watch how.

Hello= "Hello World"
Hello_World= Hello.replace("World", "Folks")

#You can also update the variable so you can put words in you have not out in the code yet Watch how!

Hello= "Hello World"
Hello= Hello.replace("World", "Folks")

#Next we will learn how to add variables together.

Hello= "Hello"
Space= " "
Name= "MrEggo"
Greeting= Hello + Space + Name

#Next is another way of adding variables together.

Welcome= "welcome!"
Question= "How are you?"
Combination_Of_Welcome_And_Question= "{} {}".format(Welcome, Question)
