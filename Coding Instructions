# Codes to remember!
# These are beginner codes.
print("Whatever you want goes inside these quotations")
you_choose_variable_name=("Integer or string. String is words.")
print(you_choose_variable_name) #Will print what you made you_choose_variable_name say. In this case it will print Integer or string. String is words
# There are also booleans which are True or False which you can assign to a variable.
print(you_choose_variable_name.upper()) #Will make the string you assigned to you_choose_variable_name all uppercase.
print(you_choose_variable_name.lower()) #Will make the string you assigned to you_choose_variable_name all lowercase.
print(you_choose_variable_name.count("t")) #Will see how many times a t appears.
print(you_choose_variable_name.find("String")) #Will  find where the word string is.

# Next we are going to do the replace function.

replace_function= "Replace Function"
replace_function.replace("Function", "Replace")

# Also you can replace with words you have not created. Watch how.

Hello= "Hello World"
Hello_World= Hello.replace("World", "Folks")

# You can also update the variable so you can put words in you have not out in the code yet Watch how!

Hello= "Hello World"
Hello= Hello.replace("World", "Folks")

# Next we will learn how to add variables together.

Hello= "Hello"
Space= " "
Name= "MrEggo"
Greeting= Hello + Space + Name

# Next is another way of adding variables together.

Welcome= "welcome!"
Question= "How are you?"
Combination_Of_Welcome_And_Question= "{} {}".format(Welcome, Question)

# The way you find out what all the functions do is:
print(help(str))

Next is math.

# Arithmetic Operators:
# Addition:       3 + 2
# Subtraction:    3 - 2
# Multiplication: 3 * 2
# Division:       3 / 2
# Floor Division: 3 // 2
# Exponent:       3 ** 2
# Modulus:        3 % 2


# Comparisons:
# Equal:            3 == 2
# Not Equal:        3 != 2
# Greater Than:     3 > 2
# Less Than:        3 < 2
# Greater or Equal: 3 >= 2
# Less or Equal:    3 <= 2

#Math Coding
num=1
num+= 1
print(num)
num2_0=1
num2_0*=10
print(num2_0)
num3_0=4
num3_0/=2
print(num3_0)
print(abs(-100)) #abs means absolute value.

#If you want to round type

print(round(3.75, 1))
#If we just typed 3.75 it would have rounded to 4. Since we put the comma it rounded up to 3.8.

#Next if we have a variable assigend to "2", that would be a string so how do we turn it into a integer? Watch how.
soon_to_be_int= "2"
soon_to_be_int2= "5"
print(int(soon_to_be_int)+int(soon_to_be_int2)
